# Online-Retail-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python
Overview: This project demonstrates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real-world transactional data from an online retail store. The goal is to help a business make data-driven decisions by uncovering key sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance insights.

Case Study:
The dataset contains transactions from 2010 to 2011, providing valuable information such as product details, quantities, prices, timestamps, and customer identifiers. In this project, you will explore and analyze these records to identify trends, outliers, and correlations that can influence strategic business decisions. Key insights such as best-selling products, busiest sales periods, and the store's most valuable customers will be visualized through Python.

Objectives:
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior
- Identify sales trends and popular products
- Provide data-driven recommendations for improving business performance
- Dataset


The analysis uses the "Online Retail" dataset, which includes:

- Invoice number, product codes, and descriptions
- Purchase quantities and timestamps
- Customer identifiers and country information
